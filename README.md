Calorie Tracker Application
Developed using JavaScript, ION Framework, HTML, and CSS, this application allows users to calculate their daily calorie intake. Users can register or log in with proper security validations. Once logged in, users can:

Register a meal by selecting an item from a dynamic dropdown menu, entering the quantity and the date of consumption, with input validation.

View and filter previously recorded meals within a selected date range.

See their current location on a live map, as well as the locations of users from other countries via a searchable text input.

The application was deployed as an Android APK and is also fully functional in web browsers.
